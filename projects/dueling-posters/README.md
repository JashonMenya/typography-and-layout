# Project Summary

This project focuses on the influence of design on the perception of written copy. You'll select a meaningful quote and create two posters with contrasting tones by manipulating design principles and elements. Here's an overview of the process:

### Process

1. **Quote Selection**: Choose a quote that holds personal meaning.

2. **Design Exploration**: Brainstorm ways to emphasize or call out words in the quote to convey different tones. Consider powerful or positive words and negative words, as well as color and typeface choices.

3. **Thumbnail Sketches**: Create at least 10 thumbnail sketches for each tone before starting final designs.

4. **Digital Design**: Select your top sketches for each tone and create digital versions in Adobe Illustrator. Tutorials on typefaces and color editing will be provided.

### Limitations and Specifications

- Your final project will consist of two (2) 11x17" posters.
- Use of color and decorative type is allowed, but no illustrations or photographs.
- Final compositions should utilize color, placement, type choice, and scale to convey two distinct tones to the viewer.
