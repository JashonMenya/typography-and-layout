# Design Binder Project

The Design Binder Project is an ongoing semester-long initiative aimed at familiarizing participants with a diverse range of designers, both contemporary and historical, who can inspire their creative vision. This project serves as a valuable resource for students throughout their academic and professional journey.

## Project Objectives

## Project Process

1. **Source Selection**: Search for captivating design work from platforms such as [Behance](#), [Pinterest](#), [Google](#), [Designpiration](#), and more.

    - Three samples showcasing the designer's work
    - A self-written biography and brief overview of the designer's portfolio
    - Personal reflection on the design (3-5 sentences) and an explanation of the inspiring elements.

3. **Tools and Medium**: Employ software such as Word, PowerPoint, Google Docs, Google Slides, Illustrator, Canva, or any preferred application.

4. **Iteration**: Reiterate the process to complete a minimum of six entries per deadline, totaling 30 entries by the end of the semester.
