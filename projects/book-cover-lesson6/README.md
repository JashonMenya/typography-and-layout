# Book Cover Design Project

In this project, you'll create a visually compelling book cover using fundamental design principles, focusing on type, color, and imagery that resonates with the story's tone and plot. Your design should give viewers an insight into the content and mood while being eye-catching and marketable.

### 4. [Submit Your Design](#submit-your-design)
Upon final revisions, submit your design as a PDF file to the Book Cover Design assignment on D2L.

## [ðŸš« Limitations](#limitations)

### No Movie Adaptation Covers
- **Avoid movie imagery:** No images from movie adaptations or illustrations from prominent editions (e.g., Disney).

### Use Authorized Imagery Only
- **Authorized Imagery:** Utilize photography or illustrations from legitimate sources like [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), Adobe Stock, or Adobe Firefly, or create your own. No google-sourced images!

### Design Considerations
- **Emphasis & Hierarchy:** Ensure your design leads the viewer through a visual hierarchy.
- **Innovation:** Avoid clichÃ© designs. Explore creative object placements.
- **Simplicity:** Remember, successful covers can be made with type, color, scale, and placement alone!

### [ðŸ›  Tips & Notes](#tips-and-notes)
- **Critiques & Revisions:** Expect and embrace them throughout the process.
- **Enjoy the Process:** Donâ€™t get bogged down trying to create or force imagery. Simplicity can speak volumes!

Happy Designing! ðŸ“˜ðŸŽ¨
