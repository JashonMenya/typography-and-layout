## A Brief History of Type

The mass production of written words dates back millennia, utilizing dyes, punches, seals, and even currency to standardize communication and commerce.

The first movable form of type was created in China during the 11th century, using ceramic materials.

Not long after, metal type began to be used in Korea.

However, in languages with thousands of characters, such as those in the Eastern languages, the printing process became a labor-intensive endeavor.

In the Western world, with a more manageable character set, **Johannes Gutenberg** created the first mass-produced book, **The Gutenberg Bible**. Movable type paved the way for the Renaissance and later the Reformation.

Most graphic artists are acquainted with the history of lettering, recognizing the evolution from the hand of master scribes to the craft and art form it is today. Gutenberg played a significant role in transforming the handwritten form into what we now refer to as typographic design.

The challenging-to-read blackletter forms in Gutenberg's work eventually gave rise to the need for more utilitarian, easy-to-read typeface designs. By the 1470s, artists like the Frenchman **Nicholas Jensen**, operating in Venice, Italy, began creating highly legible typographic forms. He was the first to design a Roman face based on humanistic characteristics. His work's beauty is still regarded today as one of the greatest typographic masterpieces.

Numerous others followed suit. Household names in the typography world include John Baskerville, Giambattista Bodoni, William Caslon, Claude Garamond, and later Ed Benguiat, Eric Gill, Herb Lubalin, Hermann Zapf, and many more.

In the late 19th century, German immigrant **Otmar Mergenthaler** developed a machine that cast a hot lead alloy into lines of type. These metal slugs, called Linotype, could be melted down and reused once they were used. The Linotype went on to dominate the typesetting industry throughout the 20th century.

In 1895, Talbert Lanceton created an automated mechanical composing process known as the Monotype system. Operators used a keyboard to prepare a punched paper tape, which directed hot metal casting to create typeset text.

Most large publishing houses and newspapers used automated typesetting systems like Linotype and Monotype.
